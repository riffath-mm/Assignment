            n competitive sporting events, drivers operate vehicles at the limits of handling, with near full rear tire
            saturation. Expert drivers intentionally drift their vehicles around corners to turn the vehicle quickly.
            These drivers operate their vehicles in a way that is contrary to the way safety systems in automotive
            electronic control units are designed. By investigating and understanding the physics and operating
            principles of these maneuvers, it may be possible to enhance safety features in automotive control systems
            for collision avoidance, as well as enable sports cars to autonomously perform drift within the context of
            racing. The main focus of this dissertation is on planning and control of drift maneuvers, in particular,
            steady state drift, drift parking, and drift cornering.
            Secondly, with the growth of research and engineering in the domain of autonomous vehicles, the dissertation
            also focuses on the design and development of a robotic platform called the Berkeley Autonomous Race Car
            (BARC). The platform is based on a 1/10-scaleremote control vehicle equipped with computing hardware and a
            suite of sensors that make it suitable for research and instruction. The project aims to provide a low-cost,
            open-source test bed option for researchers and instructors interested in autonomous vehicles. The methods
            and algorithms provided in the first part of the dissertation are experimentally validated on the BARC
            platform.

            Marvelmind Robotics is a company that develops an off-the-shelf indoor GPS. Indoor localization is achieved
            with the use of ultrasound beacons. In this application, four stationary beacons are placed at a height of
            around 1 meter at all each corner of the robocup field. A fifth beacon is attached to the drone and
            connected to the droneâ€™s on-board power circuit. This beacon is known as the hedgehog or hedge for short.
            The hedgehog is a mobile beacon whose position is tracked by the stationary beacons. Pose data of the four
            beacons and the hedgehog are communicated using the modem, which also provides data output via UART. In this
            application, the pose data for the hedgehog is accessed through the modem using a C program. This program
            accesses the data via UART, decrypts the pose data and broadcasts it to the MATLAB/Simulink file via UDP.
            All of this is executed on the Intel Nuc. The co-ordinates derived from the Marvelmind setup was mapped to
            the NED co-ordinate frame used by the Pixhawk.
